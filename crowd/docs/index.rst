**Crowd** is a social network simulation framework which simplifies and fastens the process of developing agent-based models and simulations on networks. 

**Highlighted Features:**

- Configuration files to set up simulations
- No-code diffusion simulations
- Interactive network visualization and chart generation with the graphical user interface
- Customized models with user-methods and class extensions
- Allowing the use of any Python library
- Running multiple simulations (with the same or different settings) and aggregating results
